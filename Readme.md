__<center>A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called .</center>__

---
A method is a builtâ€“in command ("function", we'll talk about them later) that needs to be called to get a value. When using without parentheses, we get this function itself. As a rule, the browser will output it something like this: `"function methodName() { ... }"`.

```js

let txt="hello"
console.log(txt.methodName); //Function methodName(){ ... }
```

And to get the result, you need to call it by adding brackets:

```js
let txt="hello"
console.log(txt.methodName()); //Value
```

___<center> <h2>STRING METHODS</h2></center>___

*<center>when we use the string type with string methods, the string is converted to an array JavaScript supports various types of arrays, string array is one of them. A string array is nothing more than anything related to a string array.</center>*

* _There are 3 types of string creation:_
  * __double quotes__

    ```js
    ("hello")
    ```

  * __single quotes__

    ```js
    ('hello')
    ```

  * __Backticks__

    ```js
    (`hello ${hi}`)
    ```

  ```

  * __The index of the last character is string length-1__
